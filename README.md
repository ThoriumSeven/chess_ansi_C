# chess_ansi_C
## Created in C as a small project to entertain myself and to push the boundaries of my capabilities

This is a small project by my(self ðŸ˜”);

This project can be used as an example on how hard it is to write a code in one file. It is strongly recommended to use libraries and such to avoid confusion when making usable code.


This project demonstrates the following:

* How arrays work
* Why it is important to document everything in your code
* When to make another function
* How important it is to stick with the basics in order to avoid headaches and insomnia


## How to compile the program 

If you are an IT / CompSci student then you probably don't need this but if you still are but you don't know then:

1. Clone this project using git
2. Download gcc compiler or clang
3. Run this code using terminal(in bash, cmd, powershell) or you can compile this on .exe to run it on windows(it would not work!)


## There is a bug!?

If you want to improve this project, please submit an issue above so that I would be aware and try to make it happen. I wholeheartedly appreciate every contribution.


## Issues 

I still don't know what issue is there but maybe some other time??

## How it works

I have no idea how for now, I have no time to document everything because the code itself is complicated, but I would like to create a documentation for others to see, but for now, let's keep it as it is(I'm very busyðŸ˜’).
